             I went on to become a Project Manager for an electrical controls company for 5 years.
             However, during this time I learned that my passion was for programming and started
             my journey towards becoming a software developer! I have learned a lot and really enjoyed
             the projects that I have gotten to work on. I look forward to getting a job in tech and
             continuing to learn even more along the way!</div>
